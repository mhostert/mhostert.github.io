Hi, I'm Matheus Hostert, a postdoctoral researcher at the Perimeter Institute (CAN) and University of Minnesota (USA). I'm primarily interested in neutrino physics and the dark Universe: new forces, dark matter, and potential new light degrees of freedom.  Like any big fan of the Electroweak sector, I am also interested in rare processes, including neutrino scattering and rare kaons decays.

\\
I try to widen our net for beyond-the-Standard-Model searches with novel proposals for precision tests and experimental signatures at current facilities. I'm currently involved in studies to explore the physics potential of neutrino oscillation facilities like $\mu$BooNE and DUNE to search for new physics.
