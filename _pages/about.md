<h3>Welcome,</h3>
  <p>
  I am a Neutrino Theory Network postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University working on various aspects of particle phyics phenomenology.
  I was previously a postdoctoral researcher with a joint appointment at the Perimeter Institute in Canada and the University of Minnesota. I earned my Ph.D. in 2019 at the Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology, part of Durham University, in the United Kingdom.

  My research aims to improve our understanding of elementary particles and their interactions.
  I am particularly interested in exploring the exotic properties of neutrinos to learn more about what lies beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics.
  I work closely with neutrino, dark matter, and high-intensity experiments to devise new strategies in the search for new rare phenomena and new particles.
  Discoveries in this field would help us answer open questions about the origin of dark matter in our universe and the nature of neutrino masses.
