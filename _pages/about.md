  <h1>Welcome, </h1>
  <p>
 I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Perimeter Institute (CAN) and University of Minnesota (US). I completed my PhD in 2019 at the Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology, part of Durham University (UK). I then moved to the US for my current joint postdoctoral position.
 </p>

<p>In my research I like to think about the role of neutrinos in physics beyond the Standard Model and their connection to potential dark sectors in our Universe. Some of my recent work is based on neutrino mass generation models with dark forces, production of light particles in kaon decays, and potential solutions to the Muon $g-2$ puzzle.
