  <h1>Welcome, </h1>
  <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Perimeter Institute (CAN) and University of Minnesota (USA). In my research I like to ask questions about the neutrino sector and explore new ideas for the composition of our dark Universe: new forces, dark matter, and hypothetical new light particles. I am interested in rare processes and precision tests of the Standard Model. Some examples include rare kaon decays, neutrino scattering, and astrophysical sources of light dark particles. </p>
