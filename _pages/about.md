<h3>Welcome,</h3>
  <p>
  I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Perimeter Institute in Canada and the University of Minnesota in the US. I earned my Ph.D. in 2019 at the Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology, part of Durham University, in the UK, before moving to North America for my current joint postdoctoral position.

    I am interested in studying and building extensions of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. 
    My work generally builds on new theoretical ideas for explaining neutrino masses and the dark matter in our Universe, and considers current and future experimental data that can discover them.
    I focus on high-intensity experiments like neutrino, dark matter, and collider experiments, where I have developed novel search strategies for light particles and beyond-the-Standard-Model phenomena.

  I am interested in Particle Physics research. My work focuses on theoretical ideas to explain the physics of neutrino masses, the existence of dark matter in our Universe, and other open questions of beyond-the-Standard-Model physics.
  Collaboration with experimental colleagues is an essential part of my work. The search for new light particles and rare beyond-the-Standard-Model phenomena is timely, and I am interested in developing this program at high-intensity facilities.
