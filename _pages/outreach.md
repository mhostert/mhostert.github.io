I tutored students at the Perimeter International Summer School for Young Physicists (ISSYP).
The tutorials involved basic concepts in particle physics as well as hands-on sessions on Python to calculate neutrino oscillation probabilities.

* Notes: <a href="https://mhostert.com/files/ISSYP_exercises.pdf"> all exercises</a>.
* Final coding exercise: plotting the electron-neutrino disappearance probability at KamLAND.

For the 2022 edition of the KITP teacher's conference, I gave a talk on the five headlines that the public *may* see coming out of particle physics. The talk was recorded <a href="https://online.kitp.ucsb.edu/online/neutrinost-c22/hostert/"> recorded </a> and slides can be found <a href="https://online.kitp.ucsb.edu/online/neutrinost-c22/hostert/pdf/Hostert_Neutrinos22Teach_KITP.pdf">here</a>.

In 2018, the IPPP team participated in the <a href="https://oisf.org/portfolio-items/oisf-2018/">2018 edition</a> of the Orkney Science Festival. Led by Prof. Alex Lenz, we visited several small islands of the Orkney archipelago, gave talks to local schools, and participated in the main programme in Kirkwall, the largest town of the archipelago.

In 2017 and 2018, I had the pleasure to volunteer and help organize two Royal Society Summer Exhibitions in London. Here are some great resources that came out from these events.

* <a href="https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2018/summer-science-exhibition/exhibits/ghosts-in-universe/">
  Ghosts in the Universe
  </a> (2018) was an exhibitions about neutrinos, jointly organized by Queen Mary University of London and Durham University.
  As part of the exhibition, we helped create several outreach resources on the topic.
  
  * <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/neutrinoscope/id1384582896">**Neutrinoscope**</a>: visualize neutrinos from the Sun, atmosphere, reactors, and the Earth.

  * <a href="https://www.xikka.com/games/nu-odyssey/">**Neutrino game**</a>: interact with neutrons around you to avoid being destroybed by the charge-current force. Developed by <a href="https://www.xikka.com/about/">Sunil</a>.

  * <a href="https://www.hyperk.org/?page_id=343">**Hyper-Kamiokande virtual reality**</a>: Observe the inside of the Super-Kamiokande neutrino detector with virtual reality goggles (<a href=""> </a> by Queen Mary).
  
* <a href="https://mhostert.github.io/files/websites/modelling_inv.html">
  Modellng the Invisible
  </a>
  (2017)
  showed the public how particle physicists can learn about fundamental physics from particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider.
  The engineers at the Physics department helped build a toy model of a dark matter experiment.
  The public could then control the design of their own detector and attempt to discover the simulated dark matter.
  The exhibition was organized by the Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology at Durham University, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxSUw38a4Vg&list=PL1zMD_kTXdjyucme9fbDmEcvrU5uyqWCS">their outreach video.</a>
