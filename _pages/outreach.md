## IceCube Masterclass 2024

<a href="https://masterclass.icecube.wisc.edu/"><img src="https://mhostert.github.io/images/outreach/icecube_logo.png" alt="IceCube"
  style="height:40px;margin-top:20px"></a>


This year, we will host an IceCube Masterclass at Harvard. 
This event brings high-school students to campus to interact with the IceCube group and learn more about neutrinos and the universe.
Students will be able to talk to the winterovers at the South Pole, analyze real IceCube data, and learn more about what a physicist does.
You can find the Masterclass poster ad <a href="https://mhostert.github.io/images/outreach/masterclass_2024_poster.pdf">here</a>.

  </a>

I tutored students at the Perimeter International Summer School for Young Physicists (ISSYP).
The tutorials involved basic concepts in particle physics as well as hands-on sessions on Python to calculate neutrino oscillation probabilities.
You can read the <a href="https://insidetheperimeter.ca/annual-pi-summer-school-immerses-students-in-a-universe-of-ideas/">insidetheperimeter.ca</a> article on the 2022 edition of the event.

* Notes: <a href="https://mhostert.com/files/ISSYP_exercises.pdf"> all exercises</a>.
* Final coding exercise: plotting the electron-neutrino disappearance probability at KamLAND.

  style="height:40px;margin-top:20px"></a>

For the 2022 edition of the KITP teacher's conference, I gave a talk on the five headlines that the public *may* see coming out of particle physics. The talk was <a href="https://online.kitp.ucsb.edu/online/neutrinost-c22/hostert/"> recorded </a> and slides can be found <a href="https://online.kitp.ucsb.edu/online/neutrinost-c22/hostert/pdf/Hostert_Neutrinos22Teach_KITP.pdf">here</a>.

In 2018, the IPPP team participated in the <a href="https://oisf.org/portfolio-items/oisf-2018/">2018 edition</a> of the Orkney Science Festival. Led by Prof. Alex Lenz, we visited several small islands of the Orkney archipelago, gave talks to local schools, and participated in the main programme in Kirkwall, the largest town of the archipelago.

In 2017 and 2018, I had the pleasure to volunteer and help organize two Royal Society Summer Exhibitions in London. Here are some great resources that came out from these events.

* <a href="https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2018/summer-science-exhibition/exhibits/ghosts-in-universe/">
  Ghosts in the Universe
  </a> (2018) was an exhibitions about neutrinos, jointly organized by Queen Mary University of London and Durham University.
  As part of the exhibition, we helped create several outreach resources on the topic.
  
  * <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/neutrinoscope/id1384582896">Neutrinoscope</a>: visualize neutrinos from the Sun, atmosphere, reactors, and the Earth.

  * <a href="https://www.xikka.com/games/nu-odyssey/">Neutrino game</a>: interact with neutrons around you to avoid being destroybed by the charge-current force. Developed by <a href="https://www.xikka.com/about/">Sunil</a>.

  * <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/2018/se/queen-mary-neutrino-research-on-show-at-royal-society-summer-science-exhibition.html">Hyper-Kamiokande virtual reality</a>: View of the inside of the Super-Kamiokande neutrino detector with a VR experience developed by the Queen Mary University group. See the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPvUvyGPcKI">preview video</a>.
  
* <a href="https://mhostert.github.io/files/websites/modelling_inv.md">
  Modellng the Invisible
  </a>
  (2017)
  showed the public how particle physicists can learn about fundamental physics from particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider.
  The engineers at the Physics department helped build a toy model of a dark matter experiment.
  The public could then control the design of their own detector and attempt to discover the simulated dark matter.
  The exhibition was organized by the Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology at Durham University, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxSUw38a4Vg&list=PL1zMD_kTXdjyucme9fbDmEcvrU5uyqWCS">their outreach video.</a>

style="height:40px;margin-right:15px;margin-top:20px;"></a>

With colleagues from the Physics and Biology departments of Durham University, I helped organize the very first Pint of Science event in Durham, UK. We had exhibitions from the Institute of Computational Cosmology and the Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology.
